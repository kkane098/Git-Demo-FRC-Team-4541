Git demo for FRC Team 4541

# Presentation Summary
## Common Git Commands
* git clone URL/.git file
  * Creates a local copy of a remote repository
* git status
  * Lists currently modified files as well as whether or not they are being tracked by git
* git add files
  * Tells git to track changes to files
* git add .
  * Tells git to track all untracked files
* git commit files –m “message”
  * Tells git to commit (store) your current changes to files to your current branch
* git commit –am “message”
  * Tells git to stage and commit all changed files to your current branch
## Other Helpful Commands
* git reset --soft HEAD^
  * Undoes your most recent commit without reversing the changes
* git reset --hard HEAD^
  * Undoes your most recent commit and reverses the changes
* git diff branch1 branch2
  * Lists all of the differences between branch1 and branch2
## Git Commands for Branching
* git checkout –b branch
  * Tells git to create a new branch (version of your repo) named branch and set it as your current branch
* git checkout branch
  * Tells git to checkout (load the changes stored in) branch and set it as your current branch
* git rebase branch
  * Tells git to apply the changes from your current branch to branch and then store the result in your current branch (makes it as if you were editing branch), which can help avoid messy merge conflicts
* git push origin branch
  * Tells git to update the version of branch stored on your remote repo (ie. Github) with the changes from your current branch
* git pull origin branch
  * Tells git to update your current branch with changes from the version of branch stored on your remote repo
## Example Workflow for Pushing
* git checkout branch-to-push (if necessary)
* git add . (if necessary)
* git commit –am “message”
* git checkout master
* git pull origin master
* git checkout branch-to-push
* git rebase master
* git push origin branch-to-push
## Merge Conflicts
* Should be fairly rare, git can usually automatically merge changes without that much of a problem
* If a merge conflict comes up, you might see a strange command line editor (vi if you’re curious) come up.  Type esc :q to exit this window (vi commands are weird and a whole other rabbit hole to go down)
* Type git status for a list of conflicting files
* Open each file in an editor and manually choose which version you want to keep, or combine the two (VSCode is great for this) 
## .gitignore
* The .gitignore file tells git what files never to track  
* For example, if my .gitignore file looked like this (everything between the dashed lines):  
=============  
*.o  
*.txt  
superSecretFile.java  
=============  
  git would never track changes to superSecretFile.java or any files ending in .o or .txt (even if I did git add .)  
* This can be helpful to prevent a repo from getting cluttered with temporary or autogenerated files (ie. executable files generated by a compiler)
